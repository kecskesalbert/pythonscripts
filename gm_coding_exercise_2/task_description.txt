Sparse vector compression

A sparse n-dimension vector has a majority of zero elements.

Example:

  [3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Tasks:

    - Define a data structure, SparseVector, for representing a compressed sparse vector efficiently.
	- Write a function, dot_product(self, other) to perform a dot product between two compressed sparse vectors using your data structure from 1.

    Ensure that the underlying data structure chosen is the most optimal in terms of both operation cost and memory usage.

Example of dot product for uncompressed vectors:

vector1 = [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3],
vector2 = [0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 1, 0, 15]

DotProduct = 8*0 + 0*0 + 0*0 + 0*1 + 0*6 + 4*1 + 0*0 + 3*15 = 49
